Download `OtakuDiscordAIO.theme.css` from either the `#download` text-channel from the support server on discord or from here. Now open Discord with BetterDiscord installed, inside the Discord settings head to `Themes` and hit the `Open themes folder` button. Now paste in the downloaded file and fully restart Discord. Now the theme will update itself.
